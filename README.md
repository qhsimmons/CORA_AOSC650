# Coastal Ocean Reanalysis (CORA)

# Overview
NOAA’s Coastal Ocean Reanalysis (CORA) provides modeled historical water levels and waves for the Atlantic, Gulf, and Caribbean from 1979-2022. The reanalysis was performed through the partnership of NOAA National Ocean Service (NOS) and University of North Carolina’s (UNC) Institute of Marine Sciences and Renaissance Computing Institute ([RENCI](https://renci.org/)). Modeling was performed by ’s  RENCI, and couples ADvanced CIRCulation Model ([ADCIRC](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476698/advanced-circulation-model/)) and Simulating WAves Nearshore ([SWAN](https://swanmodel.sourceforge.io/)) to produce data points every 300 to 500 meters. Hourly water level observations from NOAA’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) [National Water Level Observation Network](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/) (NWLON) were both assimilated into modeling, and used for [validation](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1381228/full?utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field&journalName=Frontiers_in_Marine_Science&id=1381228) of results. This repository hosts Jupyter notebooks to help users access, analyze, and visualize CORA datasets hosted via [Amazon Web Services](https://noaa-nos-cora-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) on [NOAA’s Open Data Dissemination](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination) (NODD) Platform. All previous versions (Eg. Version 0.9 used for validation, and version 1.0 used for prototyping) are considered preliminary versions and should be superseded with version 1.1 for operational use. All code is dependent on Python libraries outlined in each notebook. Please ensure you are able to access and install each for optimal performance. Please see the [NOAA Technical Report](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/cora.html#publications) for additional information. 


# Usage
An environment.yml file is included to create an Anaconda environment in which to run the notebooks. To run the notebooks, you can use the following steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NOAA-CO-OPS/CORA-Coastal-Ocean-ReAnalysis-CORA.git
cd CORA-Coastal-Ocean-ReAnalysis-CORA
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cora
jupyter notebook
```


# Notebooks:
## 1.  CORA_Accessing_Data.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how users can access CORA datasets on NOAA's Open Data Dissemination (NODD) Platform through Amazon Web Services. Model data is extracted  from the nearest model node to a user-specified geographic coordinates and displayed in a timeseries plot. 

## 2.  CORA_Visualize_Water_Levels.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how users can access CORA datasets on NOAA's Open Data Dissemination (NODD) Platform through Amazon Web Services and create a 2-dimensional water level surface plot.

## 3.  CORA_Plot_Mesh.ipynb
Interested in viewing the bathymetry or mesh that was used in the model to create the CORA data? This notebook allows users to create a rasterized plot of the topobathy at the CORA model nodes and overlay the model mesh.

## 4.  CORA_Convert_Datums.ipynb
This notebook allows users to upload a .csv file of extracted CORA time series and run it through [NOAA’s Tidal Analysis Datum Calculator](https://access.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/datumcalc/) ([TADC](https://github.com/NOAA-CO-OPS/CO-OPS-Tidal-Analysis-Datum-Calculator)) to convert data from Mean Sea Level (MSL) to other Datums. To run this notebook it will be necessary to also have the Python script and config file for the calculator, which are available on the GitHub repository.

## 5.  CORA_Compare_Time-Series.ipynb
This notebook retrieves observed hourly water levels from NWLON stations using CO-OPS [Data API](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api-helper/url-generator.html) to compare with CORA data corresponding to the same location.

| GEC | Phase and amplitude lag for wave modeling around extreme events | Improving wave convergence parameters in SWAN to better model waves in CORA-GEC | In Testing | 1.2 | 2025


## <code style="color : gold">NOTICE</code>: 
[CORA-GEC v1.1](https://noaa-nos-cora-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#V1.1/) wave datasets (swan_DIR.63_YYYY.nc, swan_HS.63_YYYY.nc, swan_TPS.63_YYYY.nc),  model wave amplitude lower and out of phase with observations at peak water levels during extreme weather events. This anomaly is due to unconstrained wave convergence parameters during [ADCIRC](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476698/advanced-circulation-model/) and [SWAN](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/hydraulic-engineering/sections/environmental-fluid-mechanics/research/swan) model coupling. Routine, high-frequency waves compare well with observations and during spectral analysis. A resolution is in testing and scheduled for release as CORA-GEC v1.2 in early 2026.
